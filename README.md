Android mobile application developed solely by me for my Final-Year Project in Singapore Polytechnic.

The purpose of this project is to create a platform to bridge pet owners / pet owners to-be with various adoption services and also to educate and provide more detailed information on their pets’ healthcare and wellness.

We have conducted a public survey, mostly targeting pet owners and pet lovers, ages ranging from as 16 to 60, in Singapore during our first assessment and the positive results received affirmed our decision to design and implement an application like this for our final year project.

8 in 10 people that we have surveyed were not aware of the other pet adoption services in Singapore (eg. AdoptADog, Purely Adoptions, Causes for Animals) other than the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).

7 in 10 people that we have surveyed thinks that it is good to have information regarding their pets’ healthcare stored on their phone for easy reference or for self-diagnosis.

9 in 10 people that we have surveyed owns a smartphone with internet connection and uses them regularly.

Therefore, we have decided to create an application that can bridge this gap between the public and the various adoption services in Singapore and also to provide a variety of pet related information and services to our users.

Some of our application features includes a page filled with pets awaiting adoption from the various adoption services, location of pet hospitals and clinics in Singapore, allowing the users to upload their own personal adoption listing and donations or sponsorships that can be made to the many adoption services in Singapore.
